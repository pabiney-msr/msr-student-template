### Jan 2017 - Mar 2017

## Overview
Implementation of a FPGA-CPU bridge for communication between a TI AM1808 ARM CPU and an Altera FPGA over the exposed EMIFA bus on the ARM CPU, which provides an interface of synchronous & asynchronous RAM, as well as DMA channelsupport. In the end, we were able to verify successful write operations to the FPGA, however, we were unsuccessful at read operations.
