### Paper
<q><b><i>Abstract - Multilayer perceptrons and their many variants have proven capable of dividing many nonlinear decision surfaces. Images, as well as video, are able to be classified using specialized multilayer perceptrons. By using keystroke probabilities as a label and the incoming image as the key, one could theoretically construct an artificial neural network capable of playing a video game. With the proper layer and hyperparameter configuration, one could theoretically overcome complex issues for artificial intelligences such as juggling multiple objectives, completing objectives in a logical order, and traversing a complex labyrinth that both changes over time as well as requires backtracking.</i></b></q>
