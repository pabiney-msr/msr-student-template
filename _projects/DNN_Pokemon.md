### Jan 2017 - Mar 2017

## Overview
An artificial neural network project investigating Convolutional and Long Short Term Memory layers with TensorFlow and TFLearn in Python with the intention of playing Pok√©mon Red/Blue on the Nintendo GameBoy/GameBoy Color/GameBoy Advance emulator project known as VisualBoyAdvance-M (VBA-M) through screen capture and keystroke generation. 
<b><i>Keywords: TFLearn, TensorFlow, Python, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Linux, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Reinforcement Learning</i></b>
