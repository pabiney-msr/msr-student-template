## Overview
In the board game Settlers of Catan, the board is composed of hexagonal tiles that are assembled into a unique conformation each game. Numbers are placed randomly on top of the tiles. When dice are rolled, each tile with the resultant number produce resources for certain players. In this project, we are using a board composed of Catan tiles to investigate 2 behaviors that are crucial to a Catan playing robot:
* Board mapping
* Moving pieces on the board
