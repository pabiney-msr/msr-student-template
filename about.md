## Overview
Patrick Abiney began his journey with computer science early in childhood, developing amateur webpages at a young age. Later he attended Full Sail University and graduated with a B.S. in Game Development. While attending college, Patrick’s love for programming, computer science, and software development were solidified. After college, Patrick worked with developers, designers, and other internal business sectors at Harris Corporation to develop and maintain existing web solutions. He then worked at Human Head Studios where he worked on several projects with teams consisting of programmers, scripters, level designers, and artists.

Patrick is currently pursuing a M.S. in Robotics at Northwestern University. He hopes to use his experience at Northwestern to broaden his skillset and pursue new topics. Patrick sees robotics as a field that is interdisciplinary and hopes to use Northwestern’s vast resources to prepare him for both an academic and practical future. In addition to core robotic courses like mechatronics, dynamics, and ROS, Patrick will investigate various topics including machine learning, neurobiology, kernel development, and other low-level software.
